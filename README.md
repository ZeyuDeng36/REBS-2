notebook contains two notebooks running our implemented Nested semantics. One is our own example, the other is the example provided on absalon.
The only file modified was semantics.py, which was added into pm4py/objects/dcr/hiearchical

This is the github repository containing the full pm4py. The notebooks can be run if all requirements in requirements.txt are installed.
